We partnered with Detect and subsequently deployed their technologies within Adani Group and have seen the massive potential for applications across various segments in our future. It has been wonderful to see them grow from a lab to a global organization, which speaks volumes for their capabilities and the scalability of their technologies. I am eager to see how Detect Technologies grows and pushes technology and industrial innovation boundaries globally.`,
